We have a [GPSBabel contributor guide](https://github.com/gpsbabel/gpsbabel/blob/master/README.contrib).</br> 
Current status of the trunk build is [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gpsbabel/gpsbabel.svg?branch=master)]. Passing is good. We like passing. </br>
The absolute[latest GPSBabel build](https://travis-ci.org/gpsbabel/gpsbabel) may not have made the front page yet.</br>

If you aren't a programmer or a writer, we need help with gear, hosting costs, tool license prices, etc. Please [support GPSBabel](https://www.gpsbabel.org/contribute.html).

## News
We moved the source here on July 31, 2015 because [Google Code is shutting
down](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) and
there is a large inertia in the open source world for Git in general and Github specifically.

As a result, some of our doc with our last release will now point to links on
[code.google.com](https://code.google.com) that will no longer work.
If you find doc that is out of date, please let us know.
(Better yet, please send pull requests with fixes.)
