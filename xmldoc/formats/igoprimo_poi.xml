   NOTE: GPSBabel should seamlessly read and convert .upoi files from your device. However, 
   when converting to .upoi format, GPSBabel will encode as UTF-8, which the device won't read
   correctly. You will need to manually convert the output file to UTF-16 LE (UCS-2 LE BOM)
   encoding using a text editor, and then it will work as expected.
